# IoT Central REST API Sample Companion Application

This project contains a sample application demonstrating the use of the IoT
Central REST APIs. It is composed of two parts - a simple CLI tool which
generates QR codes containing the required data for device registration, and a
mobile application which reads these codes, performs the registration, and
provides some basic device-management functionality.

## Prerequisites

### Tools

This sample uses [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v12+) for the CLI and
[Expo](https://expo.io/) for the mobile application. It is recommended you set
both up according to the platform you are using before continuing; you will need
information from this setup in the following steps.

### AAD Application

You will need an AAD application to authorize the mobile application; see
[here](https://github.com/iot-for-all/iot-central-aad-setup) for instructions on
how to set one up to connect to IoT Central.

In addition to the "Single-page application" authentication configuration, you
will need to add a "Mobile and desktop applications" configuration containing
your Expo callback URL. This should match the URL where Expo is hosting your
application; for example, if you are using the tunnel functionality, it will
look something like `exp://{unique id}.anonymous.app.exp.direct:80`.

Once you have created your AAD application, enter its client and tenant IDs in
`/app/src/providers/Auth.tsx`.

### IoT Central Application

In order to actually utilize the mobile application, you will need an
[IoT Central application](https://apps.azureiotcentral.com/).

## Usage

### CLI

The CLI utility can be executed by running `node index <command>` in its source
folder. The commands are as follows:

-   `config` - This will initialize the CLI configuration in the current folder.
    It will walk you through a number of steps to identify the capability model
    or device template for the devices you will be registering.
-   `device <id>` - This will generate a QR code representing the device `id`,
    along with its desired template and any other device configuration provided.
-   `template [id]` - As per `device`, but will generate a code for registering
    the template instead. This is primarily for demonstration purposes, as the
    mobile application is designed to automatically register the template for a
    provided device when necessary.

### Mobile Application

The mobile application can be executed by running `npm start` in its source
folder. This will open a webpage serving the mobile app, which can be downloaded
and run on your mobile device by scanning the presented QR code with the Expo
mobile app (if the "LAN" option does not work, the "Tunnel" option may provide a
functional alternative).

Once the mobile application is loaded, you will be immediately prompted to
login. Once you have done so, select the Settings
(<span class="mdi mdi-cog"></span>) tab and enter your IoT Central application
subdomain.

The application has two main tabs, both of which mirror the capabilities of the
other and provide basic CRUD operations on their respective entities: Devices
(<span class="mdi mdi-devices"></span>) and Device Templates
(<span class="mdi mdi-code-json"></span>). The base tabs provide a list of the
existing entities in the application, with the ability to register a new entity
via a QR code generated by the CLI tool (<span class="mdi mdi-plus"></span>).
Selecting an individual entity will load and display detailed information about
that entity (which is also editable in the case of Devices) and provide the
ability to delete that entity (<span class="mdi mdi-delete"></span>).

## Project Structure

### `/cli` - CLI

-   `/cmd` - Implementations of each of the CLI sub-commands.
    -   `/src` - Utilities and various components.
        -   `/tgt` - Code to retrieve the device template or capability model
            from each potential target location.

### `/app` - Mobile Application

Outside of configuration and top-level assets, all of the code for the mobile
application is contained under `/src`, primarily in the form of
[React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) functional components.

-   `/data` - Components representing various
    [DTDL](https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-dtdl/blob/master/DTDL/v2/dtdlv2.md)
    entities, primarily used to display device data.
    -   `/Schema` - Components used to display data as represented by DTDL
        schemas.
-   `/providers` - Components which provide general app-wide functionality via
    [Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html), including auth, settings,
    and storage.
    -   `/Api` - The IoT Central public API component and data types.
-   `/resource` - Base components providing a generic entity-CRUD framework for
    each top-level tab. This allows the individual implementations to focus on
    the data access and display that is unique to that type of entity.
-   `/tabs` - Implementations of each top-level tab in the application.
    -   `/Devices` - The Devices (<span class="mdi mdi-devices"></span>) tab,
        implemented using the `/resource` framework using `/data` components to
        display device details.
    -   `/Settings` - The Settings (<span class="mdi mdi-cog"></span>) tab,
        allowing the user to edit app-wide settings (currently, only the IoT
        Central application).
    -   `/Templates` - The Device Templates
        (<span class="mdi mdi-code-json"></span>) tab, implemented using the
        `/resource` framework.
-   `/utility` - Various common components used throughout the application.
